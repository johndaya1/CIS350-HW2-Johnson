* I Have always been interested in cars. It was the main reason I chose mechanical engineering as a major (although I didnt't have much intention of working in the automative industry)
* I was in band/orchestra from 6th grade - 12th grade so I would consider playing music an interest/hobby. My main instrument was Alto sax but I played a few more over the years. Although I have't played very much since I've started, I still havent lost all my skill.
* I am very intersted in sustainable energy research. Hydrogen electric is particularly intersting to me and before covid hit, I was planning on starting some undergraduate research on the topic. 
### Technical Background
* I was a mechanical engineering major before I was a CS major so I did programming in C using an arduino and MSP 432. Other than that, learning Java in cis 162/163 is my only other experience.
* <p> This summer I tried teaching myself some HTML, CSS, and Javascript, but am not an expert in any way.</p>
